# Higher_Lower_Game

This Python code implements a text based higher-lower game where the player compares the number of followers between two randomly selected social media accounts. The `acc` function randomly selects an account from the provided data, and the `formatting` function creates a formatted string with the account's name, description, and country. The `option` function compares the follower counts of two accounts and returns 'A' if account A has more followers, 'B' if account B has more followers, and 'C' if they have equal followers. The `ok` function updates the player's score based on whether their comparison choice is correct or not. The main loop allows the player to repeatedly play the game, randomly selecting two accounts for comparison and updating the score until the player decides to exit. Overall, the code offers an interactive higher-lower game based on social media follower counts.
